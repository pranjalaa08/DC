                Some people just want to watch the world burn. And here I am—a twist of chaos 
                and a grin that never fades. They call me mad, but madness is just like gravity: 
                all it takes is a little push. Now, let's put a smile on that face...

                In the shadows of Gotham, I rise.
                I am the night, the silent guardian.
                I watch over the city, protecting it from fear and chaos.
                They may not see me, but I am always there.
                I am vengeance. I am the night.
                I am Batman.

                Faster than a speeding bullet.
                More powerful than a locomotive.
                I stand for truth, justice, and hope.
                From the skies above to the streets below, I am their shield.
                Wherever there is darkness, I bring the light.
                I am Superman.

                Guess who’s back and cooler than ever?
                Breaking the fourth wall since day one.
                I’m the anti-hero your heroes warned you about.
                With guns blazing, and jokes sharper than my swords.
                Saving the world… but mostly for the chimichangas.
                I’m Deadpool, baby.
